# CPP Modules Project

Welcome to the **CPP Modules** project! 

This project is part of the 42 School curriculum and is dedicated to building a strong foundation in C++ programming by mastering its core concepts, best practices, and advanced techniques.

---

## üîç Overview

The CPP Modules are a sequence of exercises focusing on:
- Fundamental C++ syntax and object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Memory allocation and management
- Operator overloading
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstract classes, interfaces, and exception handling
- Templates, STL usage, and smart pointers

Each module progressively introduces more complex topics to deepen understanding and fluency in C++ development.

## üìÑ Modules Summary

| Module | Key Topics |
|:------:|:----------:|
| **00** | Basics: Classes, Members, Namespaces, I/O streams |
| **01** | Memory: Allocation, References, Pointers, File Streams |
| **02** | Ad-hoc Polymorphism: Operator Overloading |
| **03** | Inheritance: Orthodox Canonical Form |
| **04** | Abstract Classes and Interfaces |
| **05** | Exception Handling |
| **06** | Templates and Standard Template Library (STL) |
| **07** | Advanced Templates, Iterators, Algorithms |
| **08** | Smart Pointers and Custom Containers |

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Skills Acquired

- Mastery of C++ fundamentals and syntax
- Advanced object-oriented programming techniques
- Memory safety and management practices
- Practical use of templates and the STL
- Design and implementation of robust, reusable code
- Strong debugging and problem-solving skills

---

## üìÜ How to Compile

Each module comes with its own `Makefile`. To build a module:

```bash
make
```

Useful Makefile commands:
- `make clean` : Remove object files
- `make fclean` : Remove object files and binaries
- `make re` : Rebuild everything from scratch

---

## üåê Running the Project

After building, execute the program:

```bash
./<executable_name>
```

Replace `<executable_name>` with the corresponding binary name (varies by module and exercise).

Example:

```bash
./megaphone
```
